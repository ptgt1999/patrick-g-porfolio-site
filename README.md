## Descripton

A portfolio detailing the work done by Patrick Gustafson

## Installation

First I began with setting up my repositroy in github, and copying it to my local server so that i could edit the code. I then added a css and an html file to begin buidling the website. I made 7 total commits to the website, inclduing this one to update the readme. Each commit updated or changed the website to make it closer to the outline. 

## Usage

I added multiple links to allow for easy navigation of my website and to other websites.
